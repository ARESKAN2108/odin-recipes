    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked stuffed shrimp recipe was created by my late mother over 30 years ago. 
        My grandparents, father, and I have enjoyed these stuffed shrimp every other Friday 
        for many years. We've made them without scallops sometimes due to price. 
        Serve with melted butter or freshly squeezed lemon along with a garden salad and 
        rice pilaf or baked potato.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) packages crushed buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®)</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>5 saltine crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>1 clove minced garlic</li>
        <li>4 sea scallops, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped imitation crabmeat</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>¼ cup white wine</li>
        <li>20 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix crushed round crackers, parsley, saltines, celery salt, and garlic in a large bowl. Add scallops, crabmeat, melted butter, and wine; mix stuffing well.</li>
        <li>Place a shrimp on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, careful not to cut through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book. Repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>
        <li>Stuff each shrimp with a heaping tablespoon stuffing and place back-side up in the prepared baking dish. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water to the bottom of the baking dish to keep shrimp moist during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until shrimp are opaque and stuffing begins to brown, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
